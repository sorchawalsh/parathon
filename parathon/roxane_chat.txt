To help us prepare the AG, I was wondering if you're planning on remaining an active member of SCOPE in the coming semester. Thanks! 💖💖💖
27/09/2019, 14:21 - sorcha: (This is a group message sent to everybody who is in the association but didn't answer the doodle for the AG)
30/09/2019, 12:50 - Roxane? Kokka: Hi Sorcha, it's Roxane from scope. I'm letting you know that I'll leave Scope because I have too many projects going on this year, and I won't have time to participate much in all of the association's events.
See you around :)
30/09/2019, 12:56 - sorcha: Ok, best of luck with your projects, and we hope to see you around!!
